        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img class="selfie" src="images/selfie2.jpg" height="357px" alt="me">
        <p>As a Colorado native I have always loved the mountians and without them I have zero sense of direction. I learned
            that in my youth traveling around the western part of the counrty. I have lived outside of Colorado and when
            I'm out of the state I find myself longing to get back as soon as I can. You cna take the man out of Colorado
            but not the Colorado out of the man. I wouldn't dream of living anywhere else. I do take advantage of all the
            great things Colorado offers. Some of my favorites are snowboarding, Broncos, Avalanche and the 300 days of sunshine.
            My family is also very important to me. My wife Sonia and my two boys Jaxson and Samson are three great motivators
            for me. I want to be the best husband and father I can be.</p>
        
        <p>My intrest in Tech all strarted on the fateful day that my Dad came home with the Nintendo Entertinment System. My
            brother and I would play Mario Bros. and Zelda like there was no tomorrow. After about a month both my parents
            said "IF you want to play inside you've got to play outside first." we were devistated. Me being the problem
            solver that I am I would go down the street to my pals house to play there. That lasted about two ddys before
            I wa busted. My mom turned my love of video games into a challange. Next thing I knew I was enrolled in all sorts
            of computer classes outside of school. Mostly I learned how they work and what they could do. I loved it but
            once I started growing my love for computers started to dwindle and be replaced with sports, working, middle
            school drama and girls. Then like with most things my love of tech fell to the side. I know how to use a computer
            and a phone. What I Really want to do is create what I want to and help other people that might not know as much
            as me.</p>
